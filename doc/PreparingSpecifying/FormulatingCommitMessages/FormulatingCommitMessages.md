# Formulating Commit Messages

Development of documentation, specification and code shall be collaborative.  
This includes reviewing artifacts before consolidating them into the shared base. Such review is not just "additional work", but also time critical, because the shared base might change between MergeRequest and MergeCommit.  
Well formulated CommitMessages must support efficiently reviewing the contributed artifact.

This document provides guidance on 
* how to formulate concise and comprehensive headlines
* how to create references on existing documentation like the underlying issue in the commit messages

![commit_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57349523/155999192-811bc26b-cbf6-4a8d-83bf-ff8a8a44890e.jpg)

**Format**
```
    Subject line: short summary (50 characters or less)
    
    Message body: 
    * separated from the subject line by a blank line
    * additional information can be provided here 
    * additional paragraphs can also be added after blank lines
    * bullet points can be used
```

**Rules for proper message style**
* separate subject from body with a blank line
* do not end the subject line with a dot
* capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
* use the imperative mood in the subject line
* limit subject line to 50 characters or less (GitHub and some IDEs truncate commit messages in lists to 50 characters)
* wrap (body) lines at 72 characters
* use the body to explain *what* and *why* something has been done vs. *how* (in most cases details about how a change has been made can be left out)

**Subject line**  
* write the commit message in the imperative: e.g. "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug". This convention matches with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert
* a properly formed commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: "if applied, this commit will *\<subject line here\>*.
* If possible start the subject line with one of the following keywords for consistency:
    * Add 
    * Fix
    * Merge 
    * Polish
    * Refactor
    * Release
    * Remove
    * Revert
    * Update

**Information on commit messages**
* describe why a change is being made
* how does it address the issue
* what effects does the change have
* do not assume that reviewers understand what the original problem was
* do not assume the change/code is self-evident/self-documenting
* read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure etc.
* describe any limitations of the current code or delivery item
* do not include patch set-specific commands

Good examples for each of the above points can be found [here](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages).

**References in commit messages**  
If the commit refers to an issue, add this information to the commit message:
* in the subject line: as \[#issue-number\] (i.e. as link to the actual issue)
* in the body as "Fixes #issue-number"

*Example*
```
    Update commitMessage guide [#28]

    This commit adds detailed information 
    on how to formulate commit messages.

    Resolves: #28
    See also: #<issue-num1>, #<issue-num2>
```

If other documentation pages from inside GitHub or external pages should be referenced, these can be linked as follows:
```
\[add link text in square brackets\]\(add link URL in parenthesis\).
```

**Recap**
```
    Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
    blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
    you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
    and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

    Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
    are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
    Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
    change? Here's the place to explain them.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too

    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
    vary here

    If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
    like this:

    Resolves: #123
    See also: #456, #789
```
    
**VisualStudioCode (VSCode) vs. GitHub commit message**  
If changes are applied in GitHub directly, the subject line and body have own text fields:  
|![commit_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57349523/155980718-cbbb2d14-89c7-4938-9e15-70253f7252e3.jpg)|
|---|

This is not the case for VSCode. There only one textfield is available. Text can be added as in any editor (e.g. add linebreaks via return at the end of a line.):
